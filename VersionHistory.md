## Version History

### Version 1.0.1.0 [June 16, 2025]
* Removed custom Darkmode code. Switched to Darkmode rendering provided by Notepad++. This switch will reduce the plugin DLL size by 37KB for the 64-bit version, and by 48KB for the 32-bit version.
* Dock Panel icon will be rendered with Fluent or Standard icon depending on the selection under `Notepad++ menu: Settings » Preferences... » Toolbar`. [Until Notepad++ implements the new *NPPN_TOOLBARICONSETCHANGED* notification message, a restart of Notepad++ may be required for the icon change to occur.]

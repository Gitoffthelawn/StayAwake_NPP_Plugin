## Version History

### Version 1.0.0.3 (Pre-Release) [April 12, 2025]
* Removed custom Darkmode code. Switched to Darkmode rendering provided by Notepad++. This switch will reduce the plugin DLL size by 37KB for the 64-bit version, and by 48KB for the 32-bit version.
* Dock Panel icon will be rendered with Fluent or Standard icon depending on the selection under `Notepad++ menu: Settings » Preferences... » Toolbar`. [_Note: Until Notepad++ adds a new plugin message (tentative name: `NPPM_GETTOOLBARICONSMODE`) required for this feature, this feature will be implemented in an alternate way that will entail a temporary increase in DLL size by around 100 KB._]
